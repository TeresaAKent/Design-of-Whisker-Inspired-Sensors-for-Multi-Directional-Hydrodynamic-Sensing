# Design-of-Whisker-Inspired-Sensors-for-Multi-Directional-Hydrodynamic-Sensing
## Overview
This repository is for the research paper "Design of Whisker-Inspired Sensors for Multi-Directional Hydrodynamic Sensing". The paper introduces a novel aquatic whisker-inspired flow sensor that accurately predicts both flow speed and direction. The sensor is modular, waterproof, and highly customizable where design changes have significant effects on specifications like sensitivity and range. Its capabilities are demonstrated through analytical models, experimental setups, and application tests. In this repository, we provide a MATLAB application based on our analytical model. The user interfce allows researchers to change the sensor design parameters and see how these changes affect the sensor's specifications. We hope this tool will enable future researchers to apply the work presented in this paper to new flow sensing tasks.
